## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts
- Rich text editor system for creating engaging content
- User authentication with Google OAuth
- Beautiful and responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Developed with Next.js and TypeScript for better code quality and type safety

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or Yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imen-lakrib/next-blog.git
cd next-blog
```

2. Install dependencies:

If you use npm:

```bash
npm install
```

If you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

You need to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and provide the required environment variables:

```plaintext
GOOGLE_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
MONGODB_URI
NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```

Replace `your_google_client_id` and `your_google_client_secret` with your actual Google OAuth client ID and secret.

4. Run the development server:

If you use npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
